# Leetcoding Backend

Building a backend to track all the algorithmic problems I solve at Leetcode. Eventually this data will be used in the frontend application.

### Tech Stack

- NodeJS
- PostgresSQL

### How it works?

It parses the leetcode solutions directory, and generates a map of required data and writes it to the disk.

This data is then processed and inserted to DB.

### Tech Stack

- NodeJS - Runtime
- ObjectionJS - ORM
- Knex - Query builder and runner
- PostgresSQL - Database
